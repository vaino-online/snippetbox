## Structure

The `cmd` directory contains application-specific code for the executable applications in the project.

The `internal` directory contains ancillary non-application-specific code used in the project. Holds reusable helpers and SQL database models etc.

The `ui` directory contains user-interface assets used by the web app. Specifically, the `ui/html` directory will contain HTML templates, and the `ui/static` will contain static assets like images and stylesheets.
